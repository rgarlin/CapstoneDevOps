Udacity Cloud DevOps Capstone

This is a flask app that display a web page with my name. 

I used Docker and Kubernetes and Kubernetes uses the latest version 
from Docker Hub.  Since it's a rolling update the EC2 instances stayed 
the same so I have a print screen of kubectl describe deployments, 
which a mento suggested in the forum.
